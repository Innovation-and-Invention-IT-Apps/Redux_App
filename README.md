First REDUX Application for learning purpose. Expecting it to be kind of basic but it should get you some good knowledge of how the library/framework works.

Cheers.....

We are using here.....
        Webpack - for bundling
        Babel - for transpiling
        Gulp - for task running

Instead of the above we can use Browserify, TypeScript, RollupJS, or even ES5.

Well, why I used what I used? Simple. My instructor (Antonin Januska) said me to use it. Simple; isn't it?








COMMANDLINE Commands I used:

          mkdir Redux_App

          cd Redux_App

          git init

          mkdir src

          npm init

          npm install --save-dev webpack gulp babel-core webpack-stream babel-loader babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react

          npm i -g npm  (My NPM asked for an upgrade.... You may not need to do this step though.)

          npm install -g webpack gulp
              // Just want to install these packages globally so that I can use them for other projects of mine, in future.

          npm install babel-polyfill babel-runtime isomorphic-fetch react react-dom react-redux redux --save
